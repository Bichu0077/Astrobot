The listings summarize all countries' and regional authorities' space agencies with a comparative summary of demonstrated capabilities.\nThe objectives include national prestige, exploitation of remote sensing information, communications, education, and economic development. These agencies tend to be civil in nature (vs military) and serve to advance the benefits of exploitation and/or exploration of space. They span the spectrum from old organizations with small budgets to mature national or regional enterprises such as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States, the European Space Agency (ESA) which coordinates for more than 20 constituent countries, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), the Roscosmos State Corporation for Space Activities (Roscosmos) of Russia, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), and the China National Space Agency (CNSA).\nThe space agency listings are segregated to enable identification of subsets of the complete list that have advanced to higher levels or technical or programmatic proficiency in accordance with the following: \n\nEstablishment of agency, initial exploitation of space-based systems\nDevelopment of launch capability\nCapacity for extraterrestrial exploration\nDemonstration of human spaceflight capability across one or more of these domains\n\nOverview\nAs of 2024, nearly 80 different government space agencies are in existence, including more than 70 national space agencies and several international agencies.\n\nLaunch capability\nThis group of agencies have developed or are developing launch infrastructure including space launch sites, suborbital launch technology, orbital launch systems, and reusable hardware technologies.\n\nExtraterrestrial exploration capability\nThis group of agencies have developed advanced technological capabilities required for travel and study of other heavenly bodies within the Solar System.
